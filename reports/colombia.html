However, while this peace agreement was signed by both parties, the FARC and the government, the people of Colombia rejected the deal in a national plebiscite. Thus the agreement has not been implemented. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Insurgency Description</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC - EP - Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarios de Colombia, Ejercito del Pueblo) is a militant, guerrilla organization that formed in the 1960s, an offshoot of the Colombian Communist Party. It was formed a few years after a time in Colombia called </span><span class="c1">La Violencia - </span><span>The Violence - a civil war that resulted in hundreds of thousands killed and even more displaced in the countryside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">La Violencia-</span><span>&nbsp;In 1948, a popular politician, Jorge Eliecer Gaitan, a Liberal Party candidate for President, was assassinated in front of his office in downtown Bogot&aacute;. This provoked a 10 hour riot in Bogot&aacute;, razing the city and killing around 5,000 people. Gaitan was regarded to be the next President of Colombia and took a different approach to politics than leading Conservative and Liberal politicians of the day - specifically individualism and increased rural and urban political participation. Many Conservative politicians - and Liberal elites- did not approve of his method, as they had solidified control of the &lsquo;political country&rsquo; (as Gaitan coined - Colombia has a national country and a political country, controlled by the oligarchical elites). The Bogotazo - the Spanish term for the riot - morphed into a rural war between Conservative and Liberal parties, with Conservative parties encouraging rural farmers to wrest control of Liberal farmers&rsquo; lands, and the Liberal party arming rural populations to fight back. This created rural-on-rural population violence. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>In 1958, to end The Violence, the Conservative and Liberal parties agreed on bipartisan political alternation. At the same time, the government began implementing a policy called &lsquo;Accelerated Economic Development,&rsquo; which resulted in large swaths of land being taken from rural landowners to turn into large, industrial farms. That exacerbated Liberal claims that the Conservative ruling party was merely maintaining control of lands in the oligarchy. Out of this context the FARC was formed - as a guerrilla group first in Cauca, the mountains of Colombia&rsquo;s southwest, to wrest control of lands owned by the oligarchy. As the Colombian military through Plan Colombia) and paramilitary groups waged war against the FARC, they resorted to narcotrafficking, extortion and kidnapping to raise funds to fight back. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The FARC is a communist/Marxist organization, without any religious affiliation. At its heyday in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were 10,000 FARC soldiers; currently the number is around 7,000. On the political front, the FARC are linked with Colombia&rsquo;s Communist Party. </span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Civilian Agency Involvement</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Which local, state, and federal agencies were involved in the model?

In the National Planning Department - which is in charge of territorial organization and land rights - they are advocating the use of environmental conservation and rural development as tools for peace-building (through multi-lateral funding sources like the Green Climate Fund, they are interested in using climate change adaptation as a mechanism for peace-building in affected areas). The Ministry of the Environment, as well, has the lens of using the environment as a way to build a stable peace - through reforestation programs, conservation initiatives and climate change adaptation. Peace is a cross-cutting policy and the government was positioning itself to accompany the peace in any way possible. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Military Involvement</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What was the role of the military in implementing the model?</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The military were to be stationed around the &lsquo;zonas de concentration&rsquo; - where FARC members would demobilize and hand in their weapons to the United Nations.

After recruiting the young men, they brought them to a FARC-controlled area, shot them and dressed them in FARC uniforms, to satisfy the guerrilla-quotient. </span></p><p class="c3"><span>Due to the tension and the history of human rights abuses on both sides, the Colombian government asked the UN to accompany the turning in of arms during the peace process. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">International Agency/Expert Involvement</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">How - if at all - did your model, consciously or not, build upon previous models?

Thus in the peace accords, a key clause stated that the agreement would only be implemented if the country voted &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; to peace. The government signed the peace agreement with the FARC on August 26th and had the plebiscite on October 2nd. However, the former President Alvaro Uribe, whose main policy when he was in office was to suppress the FARC militarily, led a campaign throughout the country to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to peace (their slogan was &lsquo;si a la paz, pero no as&iacute;&rsquo; - yes to peace, but not this way). He campaigned against it on the platform that the FARC should not be receiving any amnesty, that soldiers should get jail time no matter what. This conflated with tensions about the peace accords, specifically that they recognized the differential needs of Colombia&rsquo;s LGBTI populations that were impacted by conflict and that the FARC would transition into a political party, with automatic seats in Congress over the next two election cycles. The vote was 50.2% voting for no and 49.7 voting for yes. President Santos recognized the legitimacy of this vote and the country is currently in a in-between stage - the cease-fire with the FARC will continue until October 31st and the government is trying to re-start negotiations with the FARC in Havana. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Applicability to Boko Haram</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><ol class="c6 lst-kix_n3y7sj4wvfmb-0 start" start="1"><li class="c3 c5"><span>Important to assess public attitudes for peace prior to arranging a peace agreement between the government and the militant group</span></li><li class="c3 c5"><span>As a part of the above, it is also important assess how the political participation of the militant group would be regarded by the electorate - specifically is Boko Haram associated with the philosophies of a failed state, like the case for FARC - Venezuela. </span></li><li class="c3 c5"><span>Parallels - militant group that started as a way to connect rural populations with resources (ie land reform for the FARC and micro-lending and security for Boko Haram); this militant group was targeted by the government and this lead to a springing up of power and anti-government tension - violence breeds violence. </span></li><li class="c3 c5"><span>Dissimilarities - FARC is an organization that is 52 years old - and FARC soldiers have been increasingly voluntarily demobilizing in recent years.
