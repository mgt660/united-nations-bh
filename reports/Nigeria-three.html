font-family:YaleNew'>The Niger-Delta region of Nigeria, comprising nine
  oil-producing states, sustains the Nigerian economy with crude oil. This
  represents 98 percent of the country’s exports, over 80 percent of government's
  annual revenue and 70 percent of budgetary expenditure.<a href="#_ftn62"
name="_ftnref62" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
114%;font-family:YaleNew'>[62]</span></sup></sup></a> However, the region has
  experienced socio-economic challenges from the “resource curse,” a phenomenon
  that includes environmental degradation, oil pollution, poverty, and loss of
  daily livelihood for communities in the region. Over the past twenty years,
  both peaceful and violent protests from different groups in the region over
  resource control have emerged. A coalition of Niger Delta militant groups,
  including the <i>Niger Delta People’s Volunteer Force</i> and <i>Niger Delta
    Vigilante</i>, began to mobilize against the oil companies in 2003. By 2004,
  several of these groups coalesced to form the Movement for the Emancipation of
  Niger Delta (MEND). In January 2006, “MEND declared war on the oil industry
  pending the resolution of long term political grievances relating to poverty
  and underdevelopment, the poor regulation of an environmentally polluting oil
  industry, and the alienation of local people from rights to land and resources
  in the Niger Delta.”<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:114%;font-family:YaleNew'>[63]</span></sup></sup></a> Militant groups initiated attacks on oil industry infrastructure, kidnapped oil
  company personnel, and engaged in illicit oil bunkering and sale of crude oil.
  These actions significantly affected revenue and foreign exchange for the
  federal government; it is estimated that the government lost 100 billion
  dollars in revenue from 2003 to 2008 and suffered a drop in crude oil exports
  to 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in March 2009, down from 2.6 million in
  2006.<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><sup><sup><span

font-family:YaleNew'>The amnesty program succeeded in establishing a fragile
  ceasefire in the region. “Subsequent [sic] attacks on the oil industry, losses
  from oil bunkering, and the kidnapping of expatriate oil company personnel have
  declined, whilst oil production is climbing back up to 2006 output levels 2.2
  million bpd.”<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:114%;font-family:YaleNew'>[75]</span></sup></sup></a> Nonetheless, the PAP was unfortunately initiated with competing political
  interests. Allegations of lack of transparency, widespread corruption and
  inflating cost plagued the program. Furthermore, the program inadvertently incentivized
  militancy: in order to receive a government payout, any disgruntled individual
  in the Niger Delta need only commit terrorist acts and subsequently request
  amnesty. Because of the exorbitant cost, flawed design, and the continued lack
  of sustainable economic development in the region, the program failed to
  achieve a lasting peace. While it achieved a degree of success in disarmament
  of the ex-militants, it lacked concerted effort in their full reintegration
  back into civil society. As a result, Niger Delta militias recently began
  resurfacing in the region, with attacks on oil infrastructure and kidnappings
  on the rise. </span></p>

line-height:150%;font-family:YaleNew'>While full presidential amnesty was
  implemented in the Niger Delta, a similar program is unlikely to apply to Boko
  Haram in the northeastern Nigeria. Before President Buhari and the National
  Assembly conclude that a similar amnesty is worthy of duplication, government
  leadership should take into account the profound differences in the two
  insurgencies, including the devastating famine, the millions of
  internally-displaced persons, and thousands of civilian deaths. Moreover, the
  high cost of implementing the amnesty program in Niger Delta region should be a
  cautionary tale to a federal government with severe economic issues. Lastly, the
  Niger Delta insurgency has proven that there is no guarantee of prevention of
  recidivism: Niger Delta militants appear to be the rise once again. Although
  the PAP was successful in achieving a short-term peace in the region with cash
  payments, it did not address the long held grievances aforementioned. For
  instance, ex-militants trained abroad in the vocational skills and higher
  education returned home and faced recurrent paucity of opportunities in the
  region. Without a more comprehensive reintegration program and holistic
  strategy that addresses the variety of drivers of insurgency, northeastern
  Nigeria could once again descend into utter chaos with monetary rewards to
  ex-fighters. After years of relative peace, the Niger Delta region appears
  poised to do just that. </span></p>
