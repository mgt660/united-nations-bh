style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:YaleNew'>After the 2009 civil war came to
  an end with government forces defeating the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
  (LTTE), Sri Lanka decided to reintegrate former combatants back into
  communities. The government set up 24 Protective Accommodation and
  Rehabilitation Centers (PARCs) across the country where over 10,000 fighters
  have been reintegrated since 2009. The Sri Lankan Model is considered one of
  the most successful approaches to reintegration, because there has been no
  resurgence of violence since the conflict. However, the lack of strong
  transitional justice measures remains a reason for criticism and is still a
  polarizing topic in Sri Lanka and globally. Other parts of the reintegration
  program, however, can be considered useful examples, namely the community-based
  approach, the relevance of recreational and social activities, as well as the
  active participation of private companies in the training efforts for
  ex-combatants. When it comes to the reintegration of Boko Haram combatants, Sri
  Lanka does offer some parallels to the conflict, as the LTTE also recruited
  child soldiers, kidnapped members of the local communities in the north east
  and committed suicide attacks. Furthermore, the Sri Lankan government faced the
  issue of few financial means to fund the reintegration program. Still, the Sri
  Lankan civil war ended with the defeat of the LTTE combatants, which
  constitutes a significantly different power balance between the parties as a
  basis for a reintegration program.</span></p>

font-family:YaleNew'>Several ex-combatants have had problems with unemployment
  and with setting up their own businesses, although the government had
  determined specific professions and geographic areas as more promising labor
  markets and provided training and assistance. These sectors, however, were
  selected intuitively rather than based on a thorough economic analysis of the
  labor market. Unemployment was not a problem that only or primarily affected
  former combatants, but rather a common problem in eastern and northeastern Sri
  Lanka. Rather than a lack of training and skills, it was the surrounding
  economic circumstances and the mismatch between the needs of the labor market
  and the qualification of former combatants that caused difficulties for former
  combatants to find employment. Therefore, it is important to accompany
  reintegration programs with investments into economic growth for the broader
  community rather than make adaptations to the reintegration program itself. New
  employment opportunities in the communities will have additional benefit by
  further strengthening community support of reintegration efforts. Furthermore,
  a thorough economic analysis of the needs of the labor market is necessary to
  ensure that former combatants have a better chance to find employment upon
  reinsertion. During such analysis, it is crucial to consider the medium term
  needs of companies, especially if economic reintegration and training efforts

  Sri Lanka and Boko Haram. However, there are also some crucial differences. The
  Sri Lankan civil war ended with the government forces defeating the LTTE

font-family:YaleNew'>Despite this stark contrast, both countries share many
  limitations, including financial constraints. Nigeria can learn from Sri
  Lanka’s strategy to involve the private sector strongly in the reintegration
  and rehabilitation efforts to offer meaningful vocational training
  opportunities. One way to accomplish that could include conducting a thorough
  analysis of the needs of the labor market before and during the execution of
  the reintegration program to determine which sectors could offer employment
  opportunities for former combatants in the future. The Nigerian government
  could receive funding from private enterprises, particularly in the agriculture
  and manufacturing sector, for education and training programs, which would also
  help sensitize the population for the rehabilitation process. In northeastern
  Nigeria processing facilities for agricultural products offer an opportunity
  for growth. They would not only bring employment, but also facilitate knowledge
  and technology-transfer, while at the same time taking advantage of the
  region’s fertile agricultural environment. Some ways to attract companies could
  be tax incentives and tax guarantees for long-term investors. If there were to
  be positive spillover effects for the local population resulting from the
  economic reintegration, these measures would potentially be substantially more
  effective.</span></p>

font-family:YaleNew'>An additional parallel between the Sri Lankan conflict and
  the Boko Haram insurgency is the prevalence of suicide attacks and child
  soldiers, which complicates the conflict. When it comes to reintegrating child
  soldiers into the community, Sri Lanka took the approach to plan a separate
  program for children, that lasted ten to twelve months. Distinguishing by
  gender and age would be beneficial when it comes to the reintegration of former
  Boko Haram combatants, because it would allow the psychological and community
  elements of a reintegration program to be tailored to the specific groups being
  reintegrated. In Sri Lanka, child soldiers were taken from rural families,
  which contributed to an unwillingness to accept ex-combatants back in their
  communities. Given the trauma that the families in the communities had
  suffered, raising community support was crucial. As is pointed out in the
  discussion of Operation Safe Corridor, receiving the support of the community
  through the engagement of local leaders could be specifically helpful. Inviting
  community members to actively participate in the reintegration process as was
  done in Sri Lanka through public festivities and joint activities, could be an
  additional path to community acceptance. </span></p>
