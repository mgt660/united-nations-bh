  established Operation Safe Corridor (OSC), a program designed to rehabilitate
  surrendered Boko Haram insurgents and eventually reintegrate them back into
  Nigerian society.&nbsp; Specifically, OSC has been designed to counter Boko
  Haram’s radical interpretation of Islam, address many of the psychological
  factors faced by insurgents freshly off of the battlefield and provide
  vocational training that will assist former militants return to their
  communities as productive citizens.&nbsp; However, while OSC shows positive

  addressed.&nbsp; The program is only designed for surrendered militants, is currently
  under resourced, and fails to address many of the human rights abuses
  perpetrated by Nigerian security forces.&nbsp; This section will further

  violence continued to escalate and spread throughout Nigeria, and included one
  of Boko Haram’s first suicide attacks on the UN compound in Abuja in August
  2011. The attack claimed twenty-three lives and resulted in another
  eighty-seven wounded. The group’s kidnapping of 276 girls from a school in
  Chibok, a remote town approximately seventy miles south of Maiduguri, in April
  2014 propelled Boko Haram into international notoriety. The abduction prompted
  the EU and the UN to place the group on their respective terrorist organization

font-family:YaleNew'>Operation Safe Corridor is physically located in a
  Nigerian military camp in Borno state’s capital of Maiduguri. Currently,
  approximately one thousand former Boko Haram militants are said to be in the
  program, of which approximately eighty percent are male and twenty percent are
  female. The average age of the participants is said to be approximately thirty
  years old. OSC consists of a twelve-week de-radicalization and vocational
  training program involving thirty-seven Nigerian agencies. These agencies
  include, but are not limited to: Department for Counter Violent Extremist at
  the Office of the National Security Adviser National Emergency Management
  Agency (NEMA), National Orientation Agency, National Youth Service Corps, Nigeria
  Identity Card Management Commission, Federal Ministry of Health, Ministry of
  Interior, National Directorate of Employment, and Nigeria Prisons Services.
  While predominantly civilian agencies run the program’s de-radicalization and
  trade training programs, the Nigerian military controls OSC’s leadership and
  security mechanisms. Additionally, participation in OSC is reserved for those
  who surrender to Nigerian authorities. Captured Boko Haram militants--defined
  here as those who do not physically surrender--are placed in other detention
  facilities and are currently not eligible for OSC enrollment. We are unaware of
  exactly how Nigerian security forces distinguish between surrendered militants
  from those who are captured. Such information was not disclosed during our
  research in Nigeria nor by our interviewee. </span></p>

font-family:YaleNew'>The de-radicalization portion of OSC consists of
  psychological counseling and religious training. Newly surrendered militants
  are given initial psychological assessments to determine the extent of treatment
  required, particularly for younger militants and those who were forcibly
  conscripted into Boko Haram. Specific psychological counseling methods could
  not be determined by our research. Interestingly, OSC authorities claim to have
  incorporated religious leaders and scholars from the international community,
  notably Pakistan, into religious de-radicalization efforts. Moderate Salafist
  clerics and leaders perform de-radicalization training by speaking directly
  with former militants and focus on countering many of the distorted versions of
  Salafist Islam.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup><sup><span

font-family:YaleNew'>The vocational portion of OSC involves training in
  predominantly low-skilled trade (e.g., agriculture, wood- and steel-working, as
  well textile manufacturing). This training is intended to provide former
  militants with skills necessary to become self-reliant once they are deemed
  de-radicalized and prepared for reintegration back into Nigerian society.
  Additionally, vocational training in a useful trade can ease reintegration into
  otherwise resistant communities. Finally, self-sufficiency theoretically
  addresses a few of the socio-economic reasons for initially joining Boko Haram.</span></p>

  psychologically evaluated at least twice during their twelve weeks in OSC; once
  during their initial entry into the program and once at the culmination of the
  program to determine whether or not they are prepared to reintegrate back into
  Nigerian society. We could not discern specifically how OSC officials determine
  whether a former militant is effectively de-radicalized. According to our
  authority, approximately thirty percent of the militants currently entering OSC
  are deemed to not be completely de-radicalized after the twelve weeks. Those
  determined unfit for reintegration are placed back into the program, but it is
  unclear whether they complete the twelve-week program again or are inserted
  into a follow-on program on a case-by-case basis. Those who are determined to
  be prepared for reintegration are sent to unfamiliar communities for a “fresh
  start” and an opportunity to reestablish themselves. Specific numbers of those
  who had been effectively rehabilitated and reintegrated through OSC could not
  be discerned. Each community's willingness to welcome former militants into their
  society was also unclear. </span></p>

font-family:YaleNew'>Although much regarding OSC is still publicly unknown, we
  were able to discern some of its potential challenges and pitfalls. While most
  Nigerian civilians understand the merits of a program like OSC, many more have
  displayed strong resistance to the program. Most northern Nigerians believe
  that the harms caused by Boko Haram should be addressed before former militants
  receive treatment and vocational training. Others fear the risk of recidivism
  to be too high to reintegrate former insurgents back into communities in the
  near term. How the FGN addresses these concerns will be vital in ensuring OSC
  or a similar program is successful; without support from those citizens and
  communities charged with ultimately reintegrating former militants, any such
  program will undoubtedly fail.</span></p>

font-family:YaleNew'>Boko Haram’s insurgency ravaged northeastern Nigeria and
  dramatically altered the lives of millions of Nigerians. As mentioned earlier,
  nearly three million Nigerians have been forced from their homes. Many of these
  Nigerians are forced to live in under-resourced, internally-displaced persons
  (IDP) camps or “host communities”—essentially shantytowns with extremely
  limited means of life support—and are draining already scarce resources.
  Additionally, as more areas of northeast Nigeria become accessible as a result
  of increased security force operations, a growing humanitarian crisis is
  emerging. The latest report from the United Nation’s Office for the
  Coordination of Human Affairs (UNOCHA) estimates that over seven million people
  are in need of emergency life-saving assistance, of which an estimated 4.4
  million remain in unsecure or inaccessible areas due to ongoing violence.<a
href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:114%;font-family:YaleNew'>[19]</span></sup></sup></a>&nbsp; An
  estimated one million northeast Nigerians suffer from severe acute
  malnourishment, including 250,000 children under six years of age. Médecins
  Sans Frontières and UNOCHA officials warn that unless immediate steps are taken
  to improve security and access in northeast Nigeria, fifty thousand children
  will likely die.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:114%;font-family:YaleNew'>[20]</span></sup></sup></a>&nbsp;
  For many northern Nigerians, these problems created and perpetuated by Boko
  Haram must be addressed <i>before </i>surrendered militants benefit from a
  program such as OSC. To do otherwise, in the eyes of many Nigerians, would
  amount to rewarding former Boko Haram militants for their violence while
  simultaneously punishing the millions of Nigerians affected by the conflict. </span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:YaleNew'>During a discussion among community and government leaders
  from Borno state in Maiduguri in June 2016, many of the participants expressed
  concern about the high risk of recidivism among militants deemed de-radicalized
  by OSC authorities and reintegrated into their communities. Specifically, most
  were skeptical of OSC’s ability to determine whether a former militant
  continued to hold radical religious views. Would a former militant subsequently
  be capable of resisting rejoining Boko Haram or similar violent extremist
  groups such as Ansaru and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)? Most
  participants believed reintegration in the near term was dangerous and called
  for a ten-year period to allow the population to heal first before
  reintegration should begin. While the feasibility of a ten-year period is
  likely unrealistic, the stakeholders’ sentiment and strong resistance to
  reintegration in the near term displays a strong lack of Nigerian community
  acceptance of the program. Therefore, we believe that OSC must be implemented
  in conjunction with similar programs aimed at developing vocational skills and
  access to jobs for the millions of IDPs affected by Boko Haram. Psychological
  counseling and rehabilitation must also be afforded to those who have witnessed
  Boko Haram’s violence and violent security force operations. Understandably,
  many Nigerians are strongly opposed to Boko Haram and, left unaddressed, can
  significantly inhibit public acceptance of OSC’s legitimacy. Establishing a
  rehabilitation and reintegration program in which both former militants and
  civilians can participate is critical to achieving public support for OSC.</span></p>

.5in;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:YaleNew'>Another challenge of OSC is that, while thirty-seven
  different civilian agencies are involved, the program is perceived to be a military-run
  initiative. OSC is commanded by a Nigerian Army Brigadier General, has a
  predominantly military officer staff, and it is physically located on a
  military camp guarded by Nigerian soldiers. Nigeria’s military has been widely
  criticized for its brutality and disregard for human rights, particularly
  during its fight with Boko Haram. In a highly critical report on Nigerian
  security force war crimes and human rights violations, Amnesty International
  documented twenty-seven extrajudicial killings committed by security force
  members in 2013 and 2014 alone. The report claimed that at least twelve hundred
  people, mostly men and young boys, had been killed and another seven thousand
  had died in under-resourced and overcrowded detention facilities.<a
href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:114%;font-family:YaleNew'>[21]</span></sup></sup></a> The most
  notorious of these incidents occurred in March 2014 after Boko Haram attacked a
  detention facility at Giwa Barracks in Maiduguri and released an estimated
  seven hundred prisoners. In the days that followed, Nigerian soldiers and
  members of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) began house-to-house searches
  of local residences in an effort to recover the released prisoners. Amnesty
  International’s investigation presented overwhelming evidence that at least 640
  men and boys, most of whom were released during the Giwa Barracks attack, were
  extra-judicially killed by soldiers and CJTF volunteers.<a href="#_ftn22"

font-family:YaleNew'>Given this history of abuse, it is highly unlikely that
  many Boko Haram militants will willingly surrender to Nigerian security forces.
  The benefits of surrender and participation in OSC must outweigh the potential
  cost of continuing to fight under Boko Haram’s banner. But as long as the
  Nigerian military is involved in OSC, it will be difficult for militants to
  willingly surrender. It is important for OSC’s future that military involvement
  be limited, with the ultimate goal of being completely removed in the near
  future. As a first step, physical security for OSC’s camp should be transferred
  to Nigeria’s National Police Force, Civil Defense Corps, or another security
  agency run and operated by Nigerian civilians. Additionally, the OSC camp
  should be immediately removed from a military base and transferred to an area
  deemed acceptable by the new agency responsible for physical security. These
  changes will immediately and tangibly display Nigeria’s sincere commitment to
  rehabilitating and ultimately reintegrating surrendered militants back into
  Nigerian communities. The militants will no longer perceive the OSC as a trap
  to overcrowded and under-resourced prisons, but as providing a real and
  sustainable path forward.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:YaleNew'>In addition to limiting military involvement, OSC
  officials must also address the legal status of surrendered Boko Haram members
  and strike the difficult balance between retribution and rehabilitation. Public
  support for OSC is limited due in large part to northern Nigerians’ demands for
  retribution for the harms perpetrated by Boko Haram. Amnesty for surrendered
  militants, regardless of whether their involvement with Boko Haram was forced,
  is nearly unanimously rejected by Nigerians. Prosecuting thousands of militants
  individually and fairly, however, will prove difficult due to the lack of clear
  evidence on individual fighters and the FGN’s limited legal resources. But
  blanket punishment, regardless of the extent of each militant’s involvement in
  the insurgency, is also an unsuitable answer as it will undoubtedly decrease
  the number of those willing to surrender. Many low-level fighters and
  supporters of Boko Haram, particularly those forced into the group or coerced
  into directly supporting the group’s activities, may be unwilling to surrender
  if their punishment is equal to that of mid-level leaders or those who took
  part in rape, murder, and other war crimes. The FGN must develop a robust
  method for delivering prosecutorial justice to Boko Haram militants while
  simultaneously avoiding a homogenous approach that disproportionately alienates
  low-level fighters and supporters. Without striking this careful balance, both
  public support and militant willingness to surrender and participate in OSC
  will likely prove inadequate.</span></p>

  and must be addressed if the program is to be successful. OSC represents a
  positive step forward for the FGN, which just two years ago seemed completely
  incapable of defeating Boko Haram militarily. The inauguration of President
  Muhammadu Buhari in May 2015 ushered in a reinvigorated effort against Boko
  Haram and reversed six years of the group’s gains. However, Boko Haram will not
  be defeated with military force alone. Similar to other successful
  counterinsurgencies, Nigeria will have to incorporate a way for Boko Haram
  militants to lay down their arms and eventually return to Nigerian society. We
  believe OSC represents the beginning of such a program and should be built on
  using lessons learned from conflicts throughout the world. With assistance from
  international governments and other non-state actors, OSC could prove to be the
  program most responsible for bringing Boko Haram’s seven-year insurgency to an
  end.</span></p>
