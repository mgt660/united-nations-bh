  protracted brutal civil war in which armed Islamic radical groups, pro-regime

  insurgency consisted of four distinct groups: the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA);

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Algeria’s brutal civil war (1991-2006), in
  which an estimated 200,000 were killed, was the result of three things: an
  inadequate post-French colonial power structures, a secular authoritarian
  regime, and the rise of Islamic radicalism. Characterized by a history of
  political violence, Algerian conflicts “evolved from resistance against the

    authoritarian regime, in which pluralism and opposition were not tolerated. The
    Algerian national identity is both Arab and Muslim, in which latent ideological
    tensions between Arab secularism and Islamic Fundamentalism would slowly
    surface. Islam was reduced to ‘official Islam.’ Meanwhile, Islam in the public

    socio-economic circumstances culminated in widespread protests and a series of
    violent attacks on government offices that were violently suppressed by
    security forces. In 1988, as an effort control further Islamic radicalization
    and stabilize the country, President Benjedid supported political reforms to
    the Constitution “based on three principles: a) the separation of power between
    the state and the FLN, which would function as an independent political party;

  accountability. Mobilizing its political message of “Neither National Charter
  nor Constitution: Islam is the Solution,” through an urban network of mosques
  and social services, the FIS won “188 of the 231 seats in the first round of

  years of deliberation, the vast majority of the 13,541 applications were denied

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Available research materials indicate that the Algerian
  government did not constitute additional reintegration infrastructure such as
  special designed camps to provide ex-combatants employment, education, and
  income support. The <i>Charter</i> only provided the means for ex-combatants to
  regain their civil liberties. Otherwise in pursuit of subverting Islamist

  support a management of religious affairs through the propagation of a
  moderate, less politicized form of Islamic teachings. The Algerian government
  employed five noteworthy techniques: (1) The government widely publicized a

  The government sponsored hundreds of external Muslim preachers to Algeria to
  convey a moderate non-violent version of Islam;<a href="#_ftn143"

  civil servants through the Ministry of Religious Affairs; (4) The government

font-family:YaleNew'>The most significant challenge was on the Algerian regime

<p class=Style2>Similarities to Boko Haram</p>

font-family:YaleNew'>There are numerous contextual similarities between the
  Nigerian Boko Haram and the Algerian civil war. The most fundamental similarity
  is that both conflicts contain an Islamist radicalization element in
  competition with a secular regime. Due to this, Algeria’s de-radicalization
  strategies could provide implementation value to Nigeria’s reintegration
  process. In particular, Nigeria could publicize former Boko Haram leader’s
  testimony. This de-radicalization strategy could result in increased community
  support and convince to jihadists to reintegrate. Additionally, Nigeria may
  benefit sponsoring external Muslim imams to preach a moderate non-violent
  version of Islam impacting a larger aspect of the radicalization environment. </span></p>

.5in;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:YaleNew'>In both conflicts, there are extensive alleged
  governmental security force human right violations. Additionally, both
  conflicts appear to be characterized by the lack of judicial infrastructure
  and/or prosecutable evidence. Due to these similarities, Nigeria may ultimately
  require a similarly comprehensive national reconciliation effort that is
  supported both internally and externally. Internal support enables resolution
  of grievances among all parties, while external support translates into
  government legitimacy and international funding streams. Additionally, both
  Nigerian and Algerian governments empowered armed civilian militias. Lessons
  from Algeria indicate that a government-sponsored civilian force left
  unaccountable may act in accordance with their own interests rather than the government's.
  This paper proposes a comprehensive set of transitional justice methods to
  achieve reconciliation for the Boko Haram conflict. Even though these methods
  differ from Algeria’s blanket amnesty approach, the idea of creating an
  internally and externally supported transitional justice system is founded on
  lessons learned from the Algerian civil war. </span></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Algerian regime, although secular, was still
  steeped in the singularly-dominant Muslim culture. Meanwhile, Nigeria is
  starkly divided along Muslim and Christian lines (roughly 50-50). The cultural
  tension between the southern Christians and ruling Nigerian government versus
  the Islamist areas in northern Nigeria may be a barrier to reintegration. On a
  positive note, relative to Algeria, the Nigerian government has established
  limited local reintegration agencies to support policy implementation at the
  local level. This is important to de-radicalize and integrate the former
  militant into society, and is preferable to a heavy reliance on current
  institutions in which reintegration expertise is not centralized or
  coordinated.</span></p>
