  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the government of Colombia
  can shed light on appropriate paths to take when considering the reintegration
  of Boko Haram combatants into Nigerian society. While the nature of the
  militancy in Colombia is different than that of Boko Haram - Marxist/Leninist
  versus pseudo-religious - the insurgencies are similar in their use of
  kidnapping, child soldiers and links with illicit activities as well as their
  presence in traditionally marginalized areas. The Colombian peace agreement was
  defeated in a national referendum, however the government and the FARC revised
  the agreement and it was passed through Congress on November 30, 2016. Nigeria
  can look to the Colombian peace process for a multi-sectoral approach to peace,
  including land reform, a path to political participation, victims’ reparations,
  truth telling commissions as well as demobilization monitored through a
  verification mission of government, FARC and UN officials. The Colombian peace
  agreement aims to build peace from both the bottom-up and top-down, fostering a
  culture of peace and reconciliation, which could inform the Nigerian path to
  reintegration of Boko Haram fighters. The Nigerian government may consider
  assessing public opinion prior to reintegration. </span></p>

    accords, spearheaded by former President Alvaro Uribe, was a stronger voice

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Myriad Pro'> Through the peace negotiations,
  several fears surfaced in the public mind about what would happen post-conflict
  - specifically that Colombia would turn into a Chavista state, ruled by
  left-wing rebels. Many Colombians are extremely familiar with the recent economic
  turmoil in Venezuela, thus feared that the agreement was painted by opposition
  forces as turning Colombia into the next Venezuela.</span></p>

font-family:Myriad Pro'>The nature of the militancy in Colombia is profoundly
  different than that of Boko Haram. Not only did the FARC start as a left-wing,
  non-religious political movement in rural areas of the country, its links with
  the drug trade and other militant groups throughout Colombia distinguish it
  from the pseudo-religious Boko Haram institution. FARC has been active since
  the 1960s and has suffered high rates of abandonment in recent years whereas
  Boko Haram only began in earnest in the last six years. </span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Myriad Pro'>Any reintegration and
  demobilization program should be accompanied by impartial external verification
  missions due to the history of human rights abuses by both the Nigerian
  military and by Boko Haram. This would follow best practices from Indonesia,

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Myriad Pro'>As with the national referendum on
  the peace agreement, which demonstrated that many Colombians were not ready for
  peace, it will be important for the FGN to survey and address public opinions
  on reintegration of Boko Haram combatants. An utter lack of popular support
  will likely condemn reintegration to failure. Considering that reintegration
  will occur on a community level, the FGN could poll the receiving community’s
  opinion on reintegration of Boko Haram combatants. </span></p>

  been heavily repressed by the national government. Opening up routes for
  peaceful participation in national politics is a key aspect of demobilization
  and reintegration. Thus, as with the reintegration of the FARC, former
  combatants should not be barred from holding political office on the local or
  national levels or from voting. Ex-combatants cannot be entirely
  disenfranchised. They must be empowered to express their grievances and goals
  in a political and peaceful manner, rather than resorting to violence. </span></p>
