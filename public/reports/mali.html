  geopolitical similarities to Nigeria and the Boko Haram conflict. Both contexts
  involve economic and political marginalization of northern territories,
  organized responses which revolve around independent states and religious
  rhetoric, and violent conflict. Unlike Nigeria, Mali has successfully brokered
  a peace agreement between the government and rebel factions. Yet a year later,
  violence in Mali continues. There is continued tension between the government
  of Mali and the still marginalized north, although violence is not restricted
  to that area. Furthermore, the full weight Mali’s DDR plans are yet to be
  carried out, resulting in a population losing faith in the government’s ability
  to end violence. Many rebel groups are still in possession of weapons. In order
  to discuss how the Mali model could be applicable to Nigera’s Boko Haram
  conflict, this section first provides a brief overview of Mali and events
  leading up to the current conflict. Then, an overview of the 2015 Algiers
  Agreement DDR strategies as outlined in the 2015 peace agreement are then
  discussed. Finally, a comparison between Mali and Boko Haram is given. Lessons
  learned from Mali, which can be applied to the Boko Haram context in Nigeria,
  concludes this section.&nbsp; </span></p>

font-family:YaleNew'>The Mali case has some similarities and differences with
  Nigeria’s Boko Haram case. Both Mali and Nigeria are in the West African
  sub-region. Both are products of colonialism and share the challenge of having
  to keep their constituent parts together within their states. The two share
  most of the conditions under which conflict and violent extremism thrive in
  their respective northern areas: poverty, lack of education, unemployment,
  ungoverned spaces, exclusionary politics, marginalization and neglect by
  government. The two also share the problem of unfavorable climatic conditions
  which make nomadic and farming activities difficult, if not impossible. Both
  cases have jihadist (Islamic) undercurrents, although at different levels.
  Again, Nigeria’s Boko Haram is said to be working in collaboration with the
  Ansar Dine and MUJAO in Mali.<a href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:114%;font-family:YaleNew'>[118]</span></sup></sup></a> Mali’s DDR is ongoing and could be a contemporary of Nigeria if the latter is
  ready to go the way of the former, and to speed up processes for a peace
  settlement. In that case, the challenges faced by the former could serve as
  lessons for Nigeria.</span></p>

.5in;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:YaleNew'>It appears that the extent to which religion plays out
  significantly in the Nigeria case is minimized in Mali. While Nigeria’s
  population seems to be evenly divided between Muslims and Christians, Mali is
  over 90% Muslim. Although in the latter, there are jihadist fighters alongside
  Tuareg rebel groups, Boko Haram and its splinter groups in northern Nigeria are
  mainly jihadists. Also, Mali’s DDR seems to be focused on the Tuareg rebels who
  went into the negotiations and signed the peace agreement. It appears the
  jihadists groups are yet to be captured in the entire process. However, if
  Nigeria is to undergo peace negotiations and a DDR process, it would have to do
  so with jihadists.</span></p>

font-family:YaleNew'>Again, in Mali, both the government and rebel groups
  agreed to the peace settlement, however reluctantly. It is not clear in the
  Nigerian case whether the government is ready for a political settlement. Also,
  although the military is not neutral in the conflict, it seems to be playing a
  role in initial efforts to disarm and demobilize ex-combatants who have
  voluntarily surrendered to the Operation Safe Corridor. If Nigeria is to go the
  Mali way, it would first have to be ready to negotiate with the Boko Haram,
  make compromises, and agree to have the pressing issues driving the insurgency
  addressed.</span></p>

font-family:YaleNew'>Mali, like most African states, suffers from most of the
  postcolonial challenges of nation-building. Like Nigeria, it has been through
  some years of civil wars and insurgencies, particularly in the northern
  regions. The inability of successive governments to adhere to the provisions of
  peace agreements, coupled with marginalization and neglect of the north have
  been a major cause of instability in the north. Northern Mali battles with
  unfavorable socio-economic conditions, political exclusion, and poor climatic
  conditions. The result has been built-up dissatisfaction, distrust, and
  suspicion leading to a series of rebellions. Mali’s northern insurgency has
  ethnic, and like northern Nigeria’s, religious undercurrents. For the fourth
  time, Mali is on the road to peace, after the signing of a peace agreement
  between the government and rebel groups. Jihadist fighters were not included in
  the negotiations, although they were also visible actors in the northern
  insurgency. If the Algiers Agreement is strictly adhered to and the DDR process
  goes well, with its many challenges addressed, Mali could be on a steady road
  to lasting peace.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:YaleNew'>With regard to its applicability to Nigeria, Mali offers a
  warning as to the consequences of delay. If a peace agreement is brokered
  between Nigeria and Boko Haram, the Mali model shows that the Nigerian
  government would have to be conscientious of timelines. We consider delays in
  Mali’s DDR efforts as a primary factor in continued unrest and waning trust of
  the government to resolve conflict. We see a strong possibility of similar
  trends in Nigeria if DDR is not followed through swiftly following a peace
  agreement. Of course, we cannot say if the Mali model would be successful in
  Nigeria, as its own success or failure is yet to be seen. Rather, we hope that
  Nigeria will consider the example of Mali and avoid similar errors. </span></p>
