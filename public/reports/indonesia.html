style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:YaleNew'>The Free Aceh Movement and Boko
  Haram share similar underlying grievances, but the broader circumstances for
  these two post-conflict reintegrations diverge significantly. In 2005, the Free
  Aceh Movement, a separatist group based in the northern region of the island
  Sumatra, signed a peace agreement with the Indonesian government. The Free Aceh
  Movement had fought for 29 years advocating for self-determination and rule by
  Sharia law, and against economic marginalization and military abuses in the
  region. While its grievances are similar to Boko Haram, the Acehnese case is
  unique due to the 2004 tsunami, corresponding influx of international aid,
  peace resolution, and granting of regional autonomy. These differences aside,
  Aceh’s programmatic challenges and successes should inform a reintegration
  program for Boko Haram in Nigeria. Official reintegration efforts focused on
  political access and economic assistance over social, cultural, psychological,
  institutional, and other elements. In Aceh, target populations, for both
  combatants and victims, were difficult to define. Community-based projects were
  a viable form of economic assistance, but proved futile for social
  reconciliation and inadequate for extensive impact on welfare and poverty. The
  Aceh Monitoring Mission, an international body meant to ensure the
  implementation of the peace agreement, provided support and confidence to the
  transition process. The Aceh Monitoring Mission and combined efforts of the
  Government of Indonesia, international organizations, foreign governments, and
  Acehnese people are credited with Aceh’s transition to lasting peace.</span></p>

  Among the many assessments of Acehnese peace and reintegration, there is

  provided the region and its people with greater political access and influence

  From Jakarta’s perspective, this autonomy has had its drawbacks, including the

  Aceh reintegration was successful at maintaining relative peace, its success in
  other areas, such as welfare, economy, and social cohesion, is less clear. The
  multiplicity of programs and stakeholders allowed for greater coverage, but
  also represented different objectives, strategies, and roles, which were
  confusing if not conflicting. The lack of a clear strategy for reintegration
  meant that effects were less limited and streamlined. Ultimately, without

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:YaleNew'>Like Sri Lanka, Aceh utilized
  community-based projects for reintegration, which had greater impact on
  perceived welfare than individual allocations. The difference between perceived

  case of Aceh suggests small, relative success with community-based projects over
  individual allocations in the context of widespread conflict and victimhood.</span></p>
