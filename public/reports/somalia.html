  provides a rich subject for analysis, particularly regarding the reintegration
  of a violent insurgency into civil society. Al-Shabaab and the Somali
  government’s response share many common themes with Boko Haram and the Nigerian
  government. Both are brutally violent insurgencies located in profoundly
  underdeveloped regions, seeking to promote their brands of extremist Islamism
  as a source of stability in the face of ineffective government institutions.
  However, while the conflict in Nigeria has its roots in religious divisions,
  disenfranchisement, and heavy-handed government backlash, Somalia is an almost
  entirely Muslim nation that is fractured along clan lines. Somalia has been
  successful in reinvigorating and galvanizing some traditional, pre-Al-Shabaab
  mechanisms, specifically the <i>Xeer</i> justice framework, which may be a
  useful model for Boko Haram reintegration and transitional justice. While an
  incomplete solution for reintegration of Boko Haram, we strongly recommend the
  adaptation of a <i>Xeer</i>-like traditional justice system composed of
  community leaders in northern Nigeria to address the unique needs of a
  population who have felt under-served by the Abuja government and abused by the
  Nigerian military. <i>Xeer</i> has been far from a panacea in Somalia; as
  insurgent violence continues, metrics that specify the degree of its success
  are nearly impossible to ascertain. The incorporation of a <i>Xeer</i>-like
  system must be implemented in concert with broader efforts to address the
  consequences of Boko Haram as well as the conditions that precipitated the
  violence.</span></p>

font-family:Myriad Pro'>One of the most important aspects of the <i>Xeer</i> system is the involvement of local community members. The clan elders, acting
  as judges, lead <i>Xeer</i> processes. There is also an effort to incorporate
  differing tribes in some cases, so that a lack of bias is ensured—in those
  instances, “the <i>Xeer</i> is an unwritten agreement created bilaterally
  between two clans.”<a href="#_ftn184" name="_ftnref184" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:114%;font-family:Myriad Pro'>[184]</span></sup></sup></a> Clan members transmit these agreements from generation to generation—this type

style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:114%;font-family:Myriad Pro'>[186]</span></sup></sup></a> This type of inclusion facilitates group participation, and allows those who

font-family:Myriad Pro'>One of the more problematic aspects of <i>Xeer</i>,
  though, is that it marginalizes and excludes other members of the community.
  Some of these exclusions involve efforts to maintain objectivity—much like in
  Western systems, persons with close family relationships with those involved in
  the controversy, individuals who have a personal grievance against one of the
  parties, and persons who have already sat in judgment of the same case are not
  allowed to attend <i>Xeer</i> hearings or processes.<a href="#_ftn187"

  discussion and judgment.<a href="#_ftn188" name="_ftnref188" title=""><sup><sup><span

font-family:Myriad Pro'>The <i>Xeer</i> system is associated with the idea of
  restorative justice. One of its main goals is to reestablish the social
  order—therefore, any punishment or penance is designed with reintegration in
  mind. The ultimate end goal, for ex-combatants and beyond, is for the community
  to be satisfied with justice and to seek to move forward after the proceedings.
  Often, victims are compensated through a Diya (blood compensation), which
  consists of either money or livestock—any kind of payment from them, or from
  their families.<a href="#_ftn189" name="_ftnref189" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:114%;font-family:Myriad Pro'>[189]</span></sup></sup></a> Those who are involved in the practice speak highly of the way in which <i>Xeer</i> promotes reconciliation. According to one ex-combatant, “in the clan justice,
  the decision is made to stop the violence: the aim is to make peace and set up
  an agreement.”<a href="#_ftn190" name="_ftnref190" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:114%;font-family:Myriad Pro'>[190]</span></sup></sup></a> Considering the importance, acceptance and legitimacy that the clan system and
  customary practices have had throughout Somali history, the traditional <i>Xeer</i> system could be considered a means to establish accountability, while
  facilitating forgiveness and acceptance of the accused.</span></p>

font-family:Myriad Pro'>In terms of application in other contexts, <i>Xeer</i> is
  particularly compelling for its cost-effectiveness and ease of start-up.
  Beginning any new program, especially one being funded by international NGOs,
  or through supranational organizations, can be complicated financially and
  logistically. However, Somalia can simply continue and revive the existing
  cultural norms as soldiers lay down their arms. The system is already in place,
  so no major new structures are needed, such as the construction of courts and
  the election of judges. Additionally, an unintended consequence of the
  application of <i>Xeer</i> to ex-combatants is the possibility of banding
  different tribal groups together. By creating further commonalities and
  cooperation among groups, the number of recruits for Al-Shabaab may decrease,
  given the lack of clan fighting and proximity to returned soldiers. Combined
  with the lack of financial cost, <i>Xeer’s</i> integration into the social
  fabric of Somalia makes the use of such a system ideal.</span></p>

font-family:Myriad Pro'>Somalia’s <i>Xeer </i>model may hold potential for
  Nigeria. While Islam is not nearly as prevalent in Nigeria, and the Islamic
  system of law is not a part of the federal, or even local system, procedures
  like <i>Xeer</i> are a crucial component of small villages, and the politics
  therein.<a href="#_ftn191" name="_ftnref191" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:114%;font-family:Myriad Pro'>[191]</span></sup></sup></a> Nigerian traditional rulers often derive their titles from the rulers of
  independent states or communities that existed before the formation of modern
  Nigeria. Although they do not have formal political power, in many cases they
  continue to command respect from their people and have considerable influence.<a

11.0pt;line-height:114%;font-family:Myriad Pro'>[192]</span></sup></sup></a> Given
  the influence of these rulers, one could consider empowering them to act as
  adjudicators in reintegration. Empowering these local leaders could potentially
  solve a problem that Operation Safe Corridor has encountered: a lack of
  community buy-in and support. Community focus may also curb the potential for
  recidivism, and allow communities to accept former combatants more readily than
  they currently do. Additionally, provided that the<i> Xeer</i> system has no root
  in religion in Nigeria, a <i>Xeer</i>-like model would circumvent some of the
  problematic aspects of <i>Xeer</i>—most importantly, the lack of women’s
  participation. Including the entire community in such a proceeding will further
  allow reintegration by all—mothers, sisters, wives, and beyond for those who
  are seeking reconciliation.</span></p>

font-family:Myriad Pro'>While there is a punitive aspect to <i>Xeer</i>, its most
  important aspect is one of forgiveness. This could be especially beneficial in
  reintegrating non-traditional ex-combatants—specifically women who have been
  kidnapped by Boko Haram, and child soldiers. With many Chibok girls returning
  to their villages, and others choosing to stay with their husbands, both would
  benefit from a transitional justice system that inherently reaffirms the culture
  of their villages, and does not punish them for being kidnapped. The same
  principle applies to child soldiers—as of 2016, the United Nations verified the
  recruitment and use of 278 children (143 boys and 135 girls) by Boko Haram
  (225) and the Civilian Joint Task Force (53).<a href="#_ftn193"

name="_ftnref194" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:

  1,010 children (422 boys and 588 girls) encountered or rescued during the
  course of military operations in north-east Nigeria, 204 (117 girls and 87
  boys) had been recruited and used by Boko Haram.”<a href="#_ftn195"
name="_ftnref195" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
114%;font-family:Myriad Pro'>[195]</span></sup></sup></a> All of these children
  would benefit from the <i>Xeer </i>process—some are still children, and
  returning to their families will be difficult. But with the community’s
  forgiveness and support, reintegration is possible. The best way to do so, as
  opposed to simply mandating their return, is to involve those who are receiving
  them—their families, and their communities.</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:

font-family:Myriad Pro'>Research and analysis of Operation Safe Corridor indicate
  that local leaders expressed reluctance in accepting ex-combatants back into
  communities. Especially in the Somali and Nigerian contexts where traditional
  local leadership has been largely degraded and dismantled, a model (like <i>Xeer</i>),
  which incorporates and empowers those leaders, may be ideal to implement in
  Nigeria. Unfortunately, the enduring violence and chaos in Somalia demonstrates
  the limits of <i>Xeer</i>. While the incorporation of a <i>Xeer</i>-like system
  may be useful in a Nigerian context, it likely will not cure all the
  interrelated insurgency issues. A <i>Xeer</i>-like system should be<i> </i>introduced
  in concert with a broader Nigerian whole-of-government approach to address the
  consequences of Boko Haram as well as the conditions that precipitated the
  violence. Of note, however, central government involvement and oversight of <i>Xeer </i>may restrict the flexibility of such a profoundly localized concept.
  Policymakers and proponents of reintegration will have to weigh these factors
  when choosing to implement lessons from Somalia’s <i>Xeer</i> system. </span></p>
