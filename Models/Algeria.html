In both conflicts, there are alleged governmental security force human right violations. Additionally, both conflicts appear to be characterized the lack of judicial infrastructure and/or prosecutable evidence. Due to these similarities, Nigeria may ultimately require a more comprehensive national reconciliation effort that is supported internally to resolve grievances among all parties and supported externally in order to prevent barriers from international engagement. Additionally, both elements involved the arming of civilian militias. Lessons from Algeria indicate that a government sponsored civilian force left unaccountable may act in accordance with their own interests rather than the government&#39;s. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c3 c5">Differences to Boko Haram</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Algerian regime although secular was Muslim in contrast to the significant cultural differences in Nigeria. This is important in that the cultural divide between the ruling Nigerian government and the Islamist areas in Northern Nigerian may be a barrier to reintegration. The Nigerian government has established local reintegration agencies to support policy implementation at the local level. This is important in efforts to de-radicalize and integrate the former militant into society, rather than a heavy reliance on current institutions in which the expertise is not centralized or coordinated.</span></p><p class="c12"><span></span></p><hr class="c10"><div><p class="c4"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">&nbsp;&ldquo;Reconciliation After Violent Conflict, A Handbook,&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance</span><span class="c1 c2">, editors David Bloomfield, Teresa Barnes, and Luc Huyse, 2003, p.19, </span><span class="c1 c2">capture the essence of reconciliation in &ldquo;Ideally reconciliation prevents, once and for all, the use of the past as the seed of renewed conflict.
