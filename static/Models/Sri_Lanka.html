The government set up 24 PARCs across the &nbsp;country where over 10,000 fighters have been reintegrated since 2009. The Sri Lankan Model is considered one of the most successful approaches to reintegration, because there has been no resurgence of violence since the conflict. However, the lack of strong transitional justice measure remains a reason for criticism and is still a polarizing topic in Sri Lanka and globally. Other parts of the reintegration program, however, can be considered useful examples, namely the community-based approach, the relevance of recreational and social activities as well as the active participation of private companies in the training efforts for ex-combatants. When it comes to the reintegration of Boko Haram combatants, Sri Lanka does offer some parallels to the conflict, as the LTTE also recruited child soldiers, kidnapped members of the local communities in the North East and committed suicide attacks. On top of that, the Sri Lankan government faced the issue of few financial means to fund the reintegration program. Still, the Sri Lankan civil war ended with the defeat of the LTTE combatants, which constitutes a significantly different power balance between the parties as a basis for a reintegration program.</span></p><p class="c13 c6"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Model Name</span><span class="c3 c1 c0">: </span><span class="c0">National Framework Proposal for Reintegration of Ex-combatants into Civilian Life in Sri Lanka</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Time Period</span></p><p class="c5 c9 c25" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">The Sri Lankan Civil War lasted over 25 years and officially ended in May 2009. The government of Sri Lanka began the process of designing their national plan for the reintegration of ex-combatants in March 2009, completing by the end of July 2009. The government determined that reintegration and reinsertion efforts should take, up to one year, preferably within 10-12 months</span><sup class="c0 c14"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c0">. The reintegration program officially started in October of 2009 with the first ex-combatants coming to the Protective Accommodation and Rehabilitation Centers (PARCs) set up by the government.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Insurgency Description</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fought for the independence of northeastern Sri Lanka to establish their own Tamil state. Their insurgency was a reaction to the increasing discrimination of the Tamil minority by the Sinhalan majority in the 1950s through 70s. The insurgency was comprised of approximately 10,000 fighters in the 1980s and 1990s. They participated in direct armed conflicts with the sizeable Sri Lankan army and also gained notoriety for their suicide attacks. The LTTE suicide bombing force is widely acknowledged to have invented the suicide jacket and carried out several hundred suicide attacks. The Sri Lankan civil war is considered an ethnic conflict rather than a religious conflict, though there is debate on the relevance of religion in the hostilities.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Civilian Agency Involvement</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">The </span><span class="c3 c0">National Framework Proposal for Reintegration of Ex-combatants into Civilian Life</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in Sri Lanka was developed by a committee that counted participants from the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights, the Ministry of Defence Public Security, Law and Order, the Ministry of Constitutional Affairs and National Integration and the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare. The International Labour Organization lent both technical and financial support to the framework development process. On top of that previous efforts to develop rehabilitation strategies by the ILO and the Sub-Committee on Livelihoods of the Consultative Committee on Humanitarian Assistance (CCHA) and the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the ILO as well as the Ministry of Employment and Labour were also taken into account when developing the framework in 2009.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Military Involvement</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">The military had recently defeated the LTTE. The role of military in the reintegration process was mainly focused on disarmament efforts, including the collection and destruction of weapons in order to increase public safety and security. Even in the economic reintegration in terms of employment, combatants could not be employed the military. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">On top of that security forces also were to contribute to reconstruction and development in the war-struck areas. The Lessons Learnt Commission found later, however, that security forces continued to be involved in industries such as private businesses and agriculture, that were not part of their </span><span class="c0">mandate</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">International Agency/Expert Involvement</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">The International Labour Organization lent their technical and financial assistance to the reintegration framework development process. Several UN agencies also participated in the reintegration process. </span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">The framework considered international best practices, including lessons learned from Saudi Arabia and Singapore. Several experts from Singapore weighed in and high-level functionaries travelled to Singapore to learn from the program. One of the fundamental parts of the model are the six modes of rehabilitation that Sri Lanka adopted and then adapted to their local circumstances</span><sup class="c0 c14"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">. These six modes included (1) education, (2) vocational reintegration, (3) psychosocial and creative therapies, (4) social, cultural and family reintegration</span><span class="c0 c8">, (5) the spiritual and religious modes and (6) recreational measures. Sri Lanka added one additional mode to the Singaporean model, community rehabilitation, which is why the Sri Lankan model is often called the &ldquo;6+1 model&rdquo;.</span><sup class="c0 c8"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0 c8">NGO Involvement</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">NGOs were initially only part of the government&rsquo;s agenda on a rather limited basis. One of the reasons for this decision could be, that NGOs did not enjoy the full trust of the people during the conflict and that people had only little confidence in the NGOs&rsquo; abilities to effect positive change and actually stay in the village communities on a long-term basis. In addition to that, NGOs were often perceived as partisan during the conflict and considered allies of the LTTE, which lead to even more distrust by the Sinhalese and Muslim population.</span><sup class="c0 c14"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">International agencies were restricted from participation and access, which was criticized widely</span><sup class="c0 c14"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and may have contributed to lower funding for the government&rsquo;s program.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Impetus for Reintegration</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">The reintegration program in Sri Lanka started towards the end of the civil war between the LTTE insurgency and the Sri Lankan government (and their security forces). Sri Lanka claimed victory and the LTTE declared defeat in May 2009, after which several thousands of ex-combatants were captured and &ldquo;surrendered&rdquo;. On top of that, several other paramilitary groups had developed over the 25 years of the civil war. These groups were also considered in the reintegration and rehabilitation efforts of the Sri Lankan government.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Criteria for Reintegration</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">The reintegration efforts in Sri Lanka targeted both combatants that were captured as well as those who surrendered. Even though the program did differentiate between the two groups and recognized that each group needs different program designs, captives and those who had surrendered were granted the same rights to participate in the reintegration program. While the program primarily targeted ex-LTTE-combatants who were the largest group of people that were to be reintegrated, the program also targeted other paramilitary groups in the region that had emerged during the civil war. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Prosecution/Punitive Component</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Transitional justice and punitive aspects of the reintegration process of LTTE combatants and other paramilitary groups have been a major object of criticism over the past seven years. While the framework itself gave the responsibility of designing a transitional justice process that would be tailored to the Sri Lankan experience to the Attorney General, the framework already stated that &ldquo;[</span><span class="c2 c0">I]t has to be highlighted that, except in cases where a failure to prosecute violates a treaty obligation, the granting of amnesties in appropriate cases to perpetrators of egregious human rights violations is most likely not precluded by international law&ldquo;</span><sup class="c2 c0"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">. This already signalled that the Sri Lankan government was not likely to prosecute human rights abuses of the Sri Lankan military. Up until today no credible process has been initiated. President Rajapaksa, who was president from 1995 through 2005 neither allowed that those responsible for alleged crimes were prosecuted or punished nor that an independent investigation was initiated, disappointing the expectations he had raised with his promises</span><sup class="c0 c2"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Forced disappearances have played a major role in the Sri Lankan civil war, especially in the last four years of the conflict. The northeastern parts of Sri Lanka as well as the Colombo area were particularly affected by enforced disappearances by the LTTE-combatants. Until mid-2016 no sincere action had been taken by the government to establish a transparent domestic process</span><sup class="c2 c0"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">. In August 2016, the Sri Lankan parliament voted in favor of a bill to create an independent Office on Missing Persons (OMP) comprised of seven members with experience in human rights and humanitarian law, whose mandate is to look into the large number of disappearances in Sri Lanka, specifically the Sri Lankan civil war</span><sup class="c2 c0"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">. It is too early to judge at this point, how effective the office is going to be.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Community Engagement</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">Community Engagement played a significant role in the reintegration program in Sri Lanka. Due to the need to save costs, the community received a relevant role not only to make reintegration more effective, but also out of necessity. A variety of private companies have participated, particularly in the economic reintegration efforts.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Reconciliation, Social &amp; Political Elements</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Committee initiated by the government in 2010 and that released its report one year later, has by many been deemed a </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Psychological Elements</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">Ex-combatants were profiled before beginning their reintegration program. They were evaluated and classified based on their crimes and their roles in the organizations and had to undergo psychological counselling upon profiling. The ex-combatants were assessed again at the end of the program.It was also very important during the process to differentiate between investigation and rehabilitation to establish trust with the beneficiaries.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Education, skills, and job training</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">Upon arrival at one of the 24 PARCs that the government installed in the Northern and North-Eastern part of Sri Lanka, the ex-combatants were profiled psychologically and socio-economically. Based on their profiles, they were put into different groups that then focused on vocational training and skill development as well as spiritual and moral </span><span class="c0">classes</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that would further advance the social reintegration. In a way this also constituted the de-radicalisation efforts of the program</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">In general terms, the government found that rural areas would offer better environments for the reintegration and reinsertion of ex-combatants due to better employment perspectives there compared to the cities. The framework emphasized that ex-combatants should have the freedom to choose which type of training they wanted to pursue. These choices included the option to found their own businesses and receive micro-loans.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">The main employment opportunities for direct employment of ex-combatants identified by the framework were agriculture and livestock development, rural industrial development, fisheries, tourism, construction activities, micro-businesses, foreign employment and &ldquo;green jobs&rdquo; &ndash; meaning agricultural and manufacturing jobs</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">The training within the PARCs allowed ex-combatants to get both, vocational training as well as higher education. They also received language courses to make them more attractive for the labour market. </span><span class="c0">Once</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;ready for reinsertion into society, the beneficiaries were equipped with basic needs kits that held a variety of non-cash resources, like household items, hygiene product, clothing etc. On top of that cash payments were also made to the beneficiaries so that they would not return home empty-handed and that they would have some freedom of choice.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Incentives</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">Beneficiaries of the reintegration program received cash payments for the rehabilitation period on a similar level as IDPs and resettled communities received cash grants. On top of that, the assumption that ex-combatants might have extra costs due to disabilities was taken into account as well when calculating the amount paid to ex-combatants. There is no further financial given to ex-combatants after the rehabilitation program</span><sup class="c0 c14"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span><span class="c7 c0"><br></span><span class="c7 c3 c0 c8">Follow-up</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">One measure that was taken in order to be able to have a better understanding of the number and the status of ex-combatants was that they were given basic legal documentation and identification cards. While this also had beneficial psychological effects in terms of giving people a sense of belonging, it was an instrumental part to monitor the implementation of reintegration efforts.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Cost Estimate</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">According to statistics published by the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation (BCGR), the program accumulated costs of USD 9,136,370 between January 2009 and September 2012 in order to manage and run the rehabilitation centres in Sri Lanka. The annual cost fluctuated depending on the number of ex-combatants in the rehabilitation program.</span><sup class="c0 c14"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Financing</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">Due to the fact that the government was lacking resources in order to finance a resource-intense program like the rehabilitation program, collaboration with the private sector was fundamental for the government. The BCGR closed over 40 partnerships with private companies in Sri Lanka that helped with custodial rehabilitation and community reintegration. A variety of companies offered vocational training programs for LTTE ex-combatants. The funding issues that the government was facing actually led to a stronger involvement of the community in the reintegration program and to a program with lower cost.</span><sup class="c0 c14"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Results/Metrics</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">The Lessons Learnt Commission&rsquo;s report was released in 2011 and showed that there were still several areas of concern regarding the execution of the rehabilitation programs. One issue that had already been anticipated to cause problems, was the lack of teachers that were able to provide the necessary training in the PARCs. On top of that the demand for permanent shelter and the availability of it</span><sup class="c0 c14"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c0">. The education in the camps is not perfectly tailored to the background of the ex-combatants. Regarding the role of security forces the report found that security forces still intervened with civilians&rsquo; private and public life, even during the reconstruction after the war.</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">Kulatunga (2015) surveyed a range of ex-combatants in order to determine the success of the reintegration efforts by the Sri Lankan government. Using the sample of the northern cities Jaffna and Kilinochchi and Kulatunga, the report found that 90% of the ex-combatants felt that they were being well-recognized in the villages. In the villages the </span><span class="c0">rate of ex-combatants was at most 25%</span><sup class="c0 c14"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">Furthermore, Kulatunga found that males integrated well back into society and while some faced problems finding permanent employment, this was mainly due to external factors. The unemployment and low level of income of ex-combatants is still an area of concern. However, this is merely due to the environmental economic situation. Women on the other hand, faced bigger challenges to reintegrate into </span><span class="c0">society</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">Kulatunga&rsquo;s work also showed that leisure, free time and social events were highly relevant factors to make the reintegration process successful. The beneficiaries of the program attended a variety of social events.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Lessons Learned</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">A considerable area of improvement is the transitional justice process in Sri Lanka and the prosecution of those responsible for human rights abuses during the civil war. The new president that was elected in 2015 still faces pressures to actually implement a credible process.</span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">Security has greatly increased in Sri Lanka, where there has been a high level of post-war stability with no act of terrorism since the end of the civil war in 2009</span><sup class="c0 c14"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0">Since several ex-combatants have had problems with unemployment and with setting up their own businesses, it can be derived that a better economic climate could have helped combatants find employment. If one were to accompany reintegration programs with investments into economic growth, both community reception of former combatants and economic reintegration would be helpful.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The reintegration program in Sri Lanka had substantial issues finding qualified personnel that was proficient in the languages of former combatants. Finding suitable and qualified personnel for the reintegration facilities is thus crucial and a big challenge.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c3 c0">Applicability to Boko Haram</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">There are several parallels between the nature of the insurgency and the potential reintegration efforts, that can be drawn between Sri Lanka and Boko Haram. However, there are also some crucial differences.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The Sri Lankan civil war ended with the government forces defeating the LTTE combatants, while the conflict between the Nigerian security forces and Boko Haram is still ongoing. Given the different power balance the attitudes towards reintegration of both, the affected population and the combatants, might be substantially different in each case. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">A similarity between the two cases is that both countries only have limited funding at their disposal to fund a reintegration program. Here, Nigeria can learn from Sri Lanka&rsquo;s strategy to involve the private sector and the community strongly in the reintegration and rehabilitation efforts, which could help lower costs or receive funding from private enterprises for education and training programs and also help sensitize the population for the rehabilitation program. On top of that, if there were to be positive spillover effects for the local population resulting from the economic reintegration, measures would potentially be substantially more effective.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">An additional parallel between the Sri Lankan conflict and the Boko Haram insurgency is the presence of child soldiers and the commitment of suicide attacks, which add further complexity to the conflict. In Sri Lanka, child soldiers were taken from local families, which further lowered the willingness of the local population to accept former combatants back in their communities.</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6 c22"><span class="c7 c15 c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c20"><span class="c23 c7"></span></p><hr class="c19"><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights. </span><span class="c3 c1 c0">National Framework Proposal for Reintegration of Ex-combatants into Civilian Life in Sri Lanka</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(2009)</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Jonathan Goodhand &amp; Nick Lewer. </span><span class="c3 c1 c0">Third World Quarterly. </span><span class="c1 c0">(1999).</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref3" id="ftnt3">[3]</a><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Malkanthi Hettiarachchi. </span><span class="c3 c12 c1 c0">Prism: a Journal of the Center for Complex Operations</span><span class="c3 c1 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">(2013).</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref4" id="ftnt4">[4]</a><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Ibid.</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref5" id="ftnt5">[5]</a><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Ibid.</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref6" id="ftnt6">[6]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights. </span><span class="c1 c0 c3">National Framework Proposal for Reintegration of Ex-combatants into Civilian Life in Sri Lanka.</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;(2009).</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref7" id="ftnt7">[7]</a><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1 c0">Centre for Policy Alternatives. </span><span class="c3 c2 c1 c0">Transitional Justice in Sri Lanka and Ways Forward. </span><span class="c2 c1 c0">(2015).</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref8" id="ftnt8">[8]</a><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Ibid.</span></p></div><div><p class="c13"><a href="#ftnt_ref9" id="ftnt9">[9]</a><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c1">Bhavani Fonseka. </span><span class="c3 c1 c0">Transitional Justice in Sri Lanka</span><span class="c1 c0">.
