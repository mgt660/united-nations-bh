300,000 Somalis have died due to violence, famine and disease.&#39; Inter-clan and intra-clan fighting and looting had decimated the Somali landscape. The entire economic infrastructure has been destroyed, political institutions no longer exist, but perhaps most detrimentally, the social fabric of Somali society has been torn apart. One of the most violent groups, Al-Shabaab, emerged in 2006.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Al-Shabaab is an offshoot of the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), which splintered into several smaller factions after its defeat in 2006 by Somalia&#39;s Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and the TFG&#39;s Ethiopian military allies. The group describes itself as waging jihad against &quot;enemies of Islam&quot;, and is engaged in combat against the Federal Government of Somalia and the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). Al-Shabaab has been designated as a terrorist organization by Australia, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of June 2012, the US State Department has open bounties on several of the group&#39;s senior commanders.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Causal Elements</span></p><p class="c1"><span>After the fall of Siad Barre&#39;s dictatorship in 1991, the former allied rebel groups split off and declared a civil war. This resulted in a humanitarian catastrophe, with hundreds of thousands of deaths and Internally Displaced People (IDP). </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>In August 1990, the SNM joined forces with two other recently formed opposition groups, the Ogadeni-based Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM) and the Hawiye-based United Somali Congress (USC). It was this alliance which ousted Barre in January 1991. The USC&#39;s hasty announcement of Ali Mahdi as the interim president resulted in an immediate split of the USC along sub-clan lines. The Habar Gedir-based faction, led by General Mohammed Farah Aideed and the Abgal- based group led by Ali Mahdi thus began a brutal intra-clan struggle for power. While Aideed and Mahdi, the major forces in the capital Mogadishu, are undoubtedly the two most powerful players, 13 other clans and sub-clans are also engaged in the struggle.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">Civilian Agency Involvement</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Which local, state, and federal agencies were involved in the model?

Research has shown that NGOs experience a number of common problems and dilemmas, including internal decision-making processes, recruitment, retention of staff, layoffs, and accountability, evaluation, structural growth, and fund raising activities. Thus far, none have been able to make progress in transitional justice. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Impetus for Reintegration</span></p><p class="c1"><span>This is actually especially problematic--there is ongoing hostility and active al-Shabaab groups remain in power, so while there have been studies regarding reintegration, there is not a specific impetus/course of action which takes the ongoing warfare and government chaos into account. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">Criteria for Reintegration</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">How were insurgents determined to be eligible (or ineligible) for reintegration? Did they have to give up their arms voluntarily (as opposed to being captured by force)? Were people who committed certain types of acts or crimes excluded from reconciliation programs?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Prosecution/Punitive Component</span></p><p class="c1"><span>A corollary to this is the belief that African traditional institutions could offer practical solutions to the crisis of modernity and, in the process, trigger a reclamation exercise. In order to make this relevant, the report emphasizes &ldquo;the need for complementarity between the international tribunals, hybrid courts and domestic legal systems with regards to prosecutions and investigations.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>In Somalia, like in Rwanda, the number of perpetrators is high and the domestic courts lack financial and human resources to try all cases. Because of the prolonged instability in the country, many judges and educated people have fled. Moreover, many legal codes were literally burnt by the Islamic Courts. As such, there is a general lack of trust in the ability of the national courts to assure a fair and transparent trial.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Despite the lack of a functioning government, local structures within Somali society have served to maintain a minimum level of stability, rule of law, and justice. One such structure is the Xeer, a dispute settlement mechanism based on clan/family cus- tomary law and elements of Sharia law, the body of law derived from the Koran and from the teaching and examples of the Prophet Mohammed. The Xeer system is still the most commonly used and reinforced justice mechanism. Somalis use Xeer to solve perhaps 80-90% of all the controversies involving crimes, especially in rural areas where lack of transportation and tradition prevent people from using other justice mechanisms.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Community Engagement</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The clan elders, acting as judges, lead Xeer processes. In some cases, the clan elders belong to the disputing clans, in other cases they belong to third-party clans. The Xeer is an unwritten agreement created bilaterally between two clans. The agreement determines the relationship between clans with regard to resources, family matters, and crimes. Clan members transmit these agreements from generation to generation. Over time, the agreements become precedents and thus form part of customary law. Xeer hearings are held in public, usually under a tree within the village or in rural areas. Several types of individuals are excluded from participating: persons with close family relationships with those involved in the controversy, individuals who have a personal grievance against one of the parties, and persons who have already sat in judgment of the same case. Women are not permitted to participate in the discussion and judgment.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Reconciliation</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The Xeer system is associated with the idea of restorative justice. One of its main goals is to reestablish the social order. Victims are compensated through a Diya (blood compensation), which consists of either money or livestock. It also serves to deter further crimes, and to reintegrate both victims and perpetrators in their communities. &ldquo;In the clan justice, the decision is made to stop the violence: the aim is to make peace and set up an agreement,&rdquo; said a male interviewee. Considering the importance, acceptance and legitimacy that the clan system and customary practices have had throughout Somali history, the traditional Xeer system ought to be considered a primary means to bring accountability to the people.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">Psychological Elements</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Does the program include psychological evaluations and therapies , therapies, and aspects for reintegration? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">Education &amp; Skills</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">Economics </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">Incentives</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Were there incentives for participation?

It is also practical: the system is already in place, so no major new structures are needed, such as the construction of courts and the election of judges. Additionally, the financial resources necessary to implement this mechanism are minimal.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6">Financing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">How did they pay for the reintegration program?
