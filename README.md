## Example Node.js project for MGT-656 HW5

This is a minimal [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
application that we are using for the second
homework assignment in MGT-656 at
the Yale School of Management.

Please refer to the class website for the
"official" instructions. Briefly, you will
need to clone this project in
[GitHub](http://www.github.com) and then
create a new workspace on [Cloud9](http://c9.io)
based on your repo. Then you'll get the 
application running and alter it.

Good luck!

## Getting started

If you're running on cloud9, you'll want to install the dependencies
first with `npm install`. Then you can run the code like `nodemon ./server.js`.
